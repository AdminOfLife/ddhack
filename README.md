RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 Windowed Mode Hack
=========================================

This is a fork of ddhack specifically made for running RollerCoaster Tycoon 2
in windowed mode without having to fuss around with VM and stuff like that.

Bugs
----

* When starting the game or changing the resolution in game, after a copule
  seconds the screen moves to the upper right corner on its own. This only
  seems to happen that one time though.
* Cursor Clipping is not implemented yet, so moving the camera with the mouse
  by moving it to the screen's edge doesn't work reliably. Right click and
  dragging still works.
